SudokuAFis a fully web-based Sudoku application designed with a focus on minimalist UI and a robust game logic.

This is an original attempt at a logic-driven, pure javascript Sudoku game. 
SudokuAF (ad free) came about from my frustrations with ads in free sudoku apps so I created this for my personal use and for my friends.
This game implements a leaderboard hosted on render and served with Node.js

Features:

Dynamic Board generation via my own custome algorithm

Real time error checking with cute lil animations.

responsive design that will adapt to pc or mobile

Tech stack:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3
Logic: Javascript (ES6+)
Deployment: Github pages

Insights:
Developing this game allowed me to experiment with matrix manipulations, DOM manipulations, and some accessibility features (such as practicing with high contrast color and a practical UI/UX)
